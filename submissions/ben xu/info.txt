This picture/playlist reminds me that while some things in life shit themselves, it’s really not so bad when you think about what matters. I chose songs that carried spritely melodies but also a bit of baggage. This can be good or bad depending on how you think about it. But at the end of the day, who cares. We’re alive. The songs are arranged in an order that flows through genres and follows my train of thought.
